Code Review Exercise
--------------------

A simple secure code review exercise to prepare for security interviews. To take the exercise, open [test.py](test.py) and identify as many security vulnerabilities as you can find. Check your answers with [solutions.py](solutions.py). Different people will find different vulnerabilities, and most people will not find every one, but a junior security engineer should find the easy vulnerabilities, while a mid-level should find all of the medium ones, and a senior engineer should find nearly all of them.
